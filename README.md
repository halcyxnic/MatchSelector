# Custom 10-man Match Selector

## How to use this program

### Step 1: Set up players
Make a new file in this folder called playerlist.txt; this will be your list of players
In each line of text, there should be exactly 3 values, separated by commas:
1. Player's Name
2. Player's ACS (Average Combat Score)
3. Player's Tracker Score (from tracker.gg/valorant)

For example:\
```
Jane,300,700\
John,250,600
```

There should be exactly 10 lines of text.

### Step 2: Run the program
Double-click on the run.bat script!

### Step 3: Share the results (optional)
There should be a file called "match_data.txt" if the program completed successfully.
Send this to your friends to share the results of this selector!
